[A boy sits in a barrel which is floating in an ocean.]
Boy: i wonder where i'll float next?
[A smaller frame with a zoom out of the boy in the barrel seen from afar. The barrel drifts into the distance. Nothing else can be seen.]
[Two trees are growing on opposite sides of a sphere.]
[A color sketch of an island.]
[A sketch of a landscape with sun on the horizon. There is text from the checkered paper at the top:]
From Page No.__
[A black number 70 sees a red package and a line indicate that the number speaks. This small panel is partly overlaid on the next larger panel, which is shifted down.]
70
70: hey, a package!
[The package explodes in a brown cloud of brown smoke. This panel is both behind the first in the top left corner, and below the last panel which has been laid on top of that corner:]
BOOM

A CAUTIONARY TALE
[Cueball talks to to his Cueball-like friend.]
Cueball: This statement wouldn't be funny if not for irony!
[Cueball laughs at his own joke in front of his friend.]
Cueball: ha ha
Friend: ha ha, I guess.
[Again a panel only with text.]
20,000 years later...
[Desolate badlands landscape with an imposing sun in the sky.]
[Girl sleeping on her side, facing away from view.]
[Many six-legged red spiders standing on and hanging from cuboids. The cuboids hang in the air with no visible means of support. Some of the spiders have made a bridge out of themselves.]
[Several stick figures stand side by side in a lineup. A forlorn male in a coat, a male with combed hair, a male with spiky hair and arms outstretched enthusiastically, a female with long hair and cornrows, a shorter female with stringy hair falling over her face, an enthusiastic female with arms raised in celebration with shorter hair, a male with short hair and a goatee, a female with curly hair wearing a dress, and a stern-looking man with flyaway hair. There is no dialogue.]

[A boy sits in a barrel which is floating in an ocean.]
Boy: none of the places i floated had mommies.
[Cueball talking to Black Hat]
Cueball: I'm a poisson distribution!
Cueball: Still a Poisson distribution!
Black Hat: What the hell, man. Why do you keep saying that?
Cueball: Because I'm totally a poisson distribution.
Black Hat: I'm less than zero.
[Cueball is gone; Black Hat is whistling.]
[Two guys, both Cueball-like, are standing at some kind of cliff edge.]
Friend: What time is it?
[The second guy (Cueball) looks at his watch in silence.]
[Then he answers the question]
Cueball: Now.
[Full scene is revealed: The two men (barely visible) are standing at the lip of a huge canyon in a rocky, barren landscape. A pock-marked moon and a ringed planet are visible in the burgundy-colored sky.]
[The two guys are again seen standing at what is now know to be the lip of the canyon.]
Friend: That's a pretty boring answer.
[Next panel is the same as before.]
Cueball: Is not.
[Last panel is the same as before.]
Cueball: It's the least boring answer imaginable.
[Colored drawing of a hilly grassy landscape, Cueball leaning against a tree.]
Cueball: Sometimes I just can't get outraged over copyright law
[A person is standing on top of a green dinosaur and holding reins to the dinosaur's head.]
Person: Before you talk to me, I should warn you: I am kind of strange
[The comic is drawn on blue-ruled graph paper.]
[Cueball with raised hands talks to two other Cueball-like characters and one Megan]
Cueball: We are the Knights who say... Ni!!
Two guys and Megan: hahaha
[There is only text in the second panel]
Does anyone else find it funny that decades later, people are still quoting --word-for-word-- a group loved for their mastery of shock, the unexpected, and defiance of convention?
[Two Cueball guys looking at a third hairy guy.]
Hairy guy: We are the Knights who... oh, God, I'm so sorry
[Close up off hairy guy's face.]
Hairy guy: So sorry, the car just came too fast and
[Words crumpled inside the panel, there's barely enough space for the hairy guy to the right and below the text. The last two words need to be to the right of him.]
Hairy guy: 
She was right there and
I saw her and then it
was a blur and so much
I ran to 
help didn't 
know what 
she wasn't 
moving I'm 
so sorry 


... 
so 
sorry


[Same two guys looking again at the hairy guy.]
Hairy guy: Anyway, yeah, Knights who say "Ni."
[Last panel is also almost only text written centered, in marquee format. Below is a drawing that could look like a flat infinity sign with two small lines at the center.]

Not to be confused with Randall's what if? blog.
[A large black circle with white bubbles inside it, filled with hearts, question marks, and stick figure couples. The hearts are colored red.]
[Bottom left circle - stick figure couple with a heart]
[Top right circle - with couple:]
what if this isn't everything it should be?
[Two circles left of top-right:]
i'm not even sure how i feel
[One circle right of top-right:] 
what if i'm making a mistake?
[Above the frame:]
This one is entirely James' fault.
[Two Cueball-like guys are standing and talking.]
Cueball: Here, take a bite of this Snapple.
Guy: food!
[Guy takes a bite.]
Guy: Ow! 
Snapple and teeth: Clink
Guy: What is this?
[Cueball explains:]
Cueball: It's an apple infused with tin.
[The two guys continue to stand as if frozen.]
[Above two silent guys the following text is written inside a black frame:]
Those of you who know your periodic table should be laughing right about now.
"I count the moments we're apart. And add them up mathematically 
and multiply them by the kisses supposedly I've been missing. 
Divided by the attention not to mention the affection. 
Subtract that from your gross potential and see I ain't missin' none. 
Cause any percentage of you is as good the whole pie. 
Any fractions thereof brings dividends of interest. 
Any percentage of you is as good as the whole pie. 
Any fractions thereof brings dividends of love. 

I take the square root and get boxed in every time. 
When I know the shortest distance between two points is in a straight line. 
I'ma go into you, I'ma come into you two times, and carry the fun over the one to where we equal one.”
(Chorus 2x)
Cause any percentage of you is as good the whole pie. 
Any fractions thereof brings dividends of interest. 
Any percentage of you is as good as the whole pie. 
Any fractions thereof brings dividends of love. 
"When I was young I told a tale of buried gold, and men from leagues around dug in the woods. I dug myself."
"But why?"
"I thought the tale of treasure might be true."
"You said you made it up."
"I know I did, but I didn't know I had. I forget things, too."
[George Clinton indicates one of two equations on the blackboard to the left. There are one more equation and a diagram on the blackboard to the right that exits the frame. The first part of the text is above the blackboards:]
I once tried to start the urban legend that George Clinton has a B.A. in mathematics
[On the left blackboard are two formulas, George points to the lower one:]
L(F(t) = F(s) = ∫∞0f(t)e-stdt
L-1 (F(s)) = f(t) = ∫∞0 F(t)estdt
[On the right blackboard are one formula (partly) and an diagram with an x-y scale and three other lines touching down to the base. Above these lines are some numbers, that are partly indecipherable.]

...but I wanted it to be true so badly that I started believing it myself.
[A color drawing of a ferret with airplane wings and tail on it.]
[Two Cueball and his Cueball-like friend (to the left) are talking.]
Friend: Why on earth did you make those wings? You don't seriously think they could let your ferret fly, right?
Cueball: I... of course not.
[They continue to talk.]
Cueball: That would be pretty dumb. It's just, uh... ...a Halloween costume.
Friend: oh, okay.
[They continue to talk. But now the head of the ferret can be seen to the far right on a table.]
Friend: Besides, who would want a pet to fly anyway?
Cueball: Yeah. Pretty lame, huh?
[The friend leaves the frame while Cueball stays. The ferret cannot be seen,]
Friend: Anyway, let's go play video games.
[Cueball stands behind after his friend has left. He looks back towards his Ferret which can be seen more clearly this time standing on the table.]
[Cueball imagines ferret flying over the ocean near the beach using his makeshift wings. The imagination is in color]
[Two Cueball-like guys stand in an aisle in a store.]
Cueball-like guy: Nice store. How do you keep the floors so clean?
Cueball the store manager: Oh, we hired this dude named Kepler, he's really good. Hard worker. Doesn't mind the monotony. Sweeps out the same area every night.
[Large vortex, spinning water covers the whole panel. A boy in a floating barrel is near the edge, apparently about to be sucked in.]
Boy: wow!
The boy expressed optimism in 'Barrel - Part 1.' In 'Ferret,' Cueball expresses his dreams. However, in 'Barrel - Part 2' the boy expressed disappointment. The first two may be consistent with 'wonder' but the last isn't. Here, in 'Part 3,' he's more likely to be expressing awe than wonder. It depends on the inflection of the word, "Wow." --DP9000 (talk) 22:30, 6 March 2016 (UTC)
Not relevant here but see 1117: My Sky for the upside down WOW. --Dgbrt (talk) 20:30, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
[A collection of phrases on T-shirts. The first and the last on actual black T-shirts worn by the same person, whose facial expression is more sad on the last one.]
I see dumb people
As a matter of fact the world does revolve around me
I can only please one person per day / today is not your day.
You know what your problem is? You're stupid.
Get a clue
Do I look like a people person?
Your village called / they want their idiot back
Go away
I hate you all
Die.
Help.
Maybe if this T-shirt is witty enough, someone will finally love me.
Oh God I'm so alone.
Drawn during an unending NASA lecture
[Two people are talking, one in a hat.]
Cueball: it's just so hard to compare kids now with kids in the past. you can't help but to belong to one group or the other.
Cueball: and of course every generation seems awful to the one before it. look at quotes from throughout history.
Hatted: yeah, and it sure would be nice to have some historical perspective on some of this stuff. I just don't know what to make of it.
[Circles are appearing--maybe snow?]
Cueball: i guess you do what you can to help the people around you and hope it turns out okay.
Cueball: in the end, what else can you do?
Hatted: lead a crusade?
[We can no longer see the people, just the circles.]
it's presentism, man. the idea that historical context is irrelevant, that we understand it
all that we need take no warnings from the follies of the past. that we're facing something new.
socrates couldn't imagine the internet. but people don't change.
[We can start to see a darker circle in the lower right corner.]
(The borders between the three panels on this line are cracking.)
have you seen those collections of historical pornography? talk about historical context.
did you know the first porn photo was bestial in.
[inside a circle:] nature?
at least that stuff was out of the mainstream
[each word in one circle:]
no
just
in
history
(the three panels have merged into one on each row.)
i don't know about you, but
[circled] I
[uncircled] never
even once seen
[The circles are highly variable in size now, and pressed up against a larger one on the right side.]
[There is mass of circles of different sizes, with some dark fissures in between, against the side of a large circle which we can see part of in the right half of the panel. They look like cells. There's a tiny square in the center of the giant cell.]
[We see only the tiny square, centered. It has a few marks inside it.]
[Closer, the square is divided into rectangles of different sizes, each of which has text in it.]
[Much closer, we can see fragments of the text. Some are sideways, some are cut off, some are too small to read.]

[There is a heart at the bottom and, in the lower left, the name Kurt.]
[The same as the previous panel, but with the words blurred out to scribbles.]
[Jagged, shaded shapes and strands start to fall. Faint panel borders appear again. There is a person on the far right.]
(Back to three panels per row.)
[Cueball and Megan are standing amid the fragments.]
Man: There's too much. And so little feels important.
[The jagged edge of the shaded area is encroaching on the sides of the panel.]
What do you do?
[We see them from farther away through a rough hole in the shaded area. Bits continue to fall around them.]
[They are holding hands.]
[The barrel is shown on a grid paper background, floating sideways and empty in a choppy sea.]
[Cueball talks on phone. A grotesque-looking cat with many sharp vertical points looks on.]
Cueball: Hi, Dr. Elizabeth?  Yeah, uh ... I accidentally took the Fourier transform of my cat...
Cat: Meow!
[A collection of fictional meat based cereals in bright colors with nice pictures on them.]
Pork Loops

Hey, these don't taste like Scrapple!

Honey Bunches of Goats
Hey, these don't taste like Scrapple!
Q: What do you get when you cross an Elephant with a Rhino?
[Picture of elephant, mathematical addition symbol, picture of rhino, equals sign, large question mark.]
A: I haven't a goddamn clue.
[Black Hat and Cueball are talking together in the same position in all four panels.]
Cueball: Learning about the Holocaust has really shaken my belief in God.
Black Hat: You know, as a young man, Hitler was rejected from art school.
Cueball: Yeah... shame he didn't get in.
Black Hat: Well, have you seen any of his paintings? They're awful. Defy all rules of composition.
Cueball: What are you suggesting?
Black Hat: Maybe there is a god, but he's a real art lover.
Cueball: This is why I don't go out in public with you.
[Three people stand outside a restaurant; Megan, a man with some hair and another shorter person, probably a woman. There is a sign above the door and a menu next to it. Outside the door, there's a maître d' with a cap behind a lectern. There is sign on the lectern.]
maître d': Donner, party of four?
Man: Actually, never mind.
Megan: We're full.
Sign over door: Joe's
Menu: Menu
Sign on lectern: Eat in
So you think that's why Kramer is missing from that episode?  108.162.219.58 01:20, 1 February 2014 (UTC)
I feel that it may not have been intended by Randall, but a good pickup nonetheless.  108.162.219.58 01:20, 1 February 2014 (UTC)

[Zoomed out view of boy floating on piece of driftwood in ocean.]
[Ferret with airplane wings and tail above the ocean.]
[The empty ocean.]
[Flying ferret carrying the boy to safety.]
[Ocean with ferret carrying boy in distance, sun on the horizon.]
[At the top of the panel is a black frame with the following text:]
This one is mostly by my little brother, Doug.
[A Cueball-like guy stands on a the top of a tall pole and talks to his Cueball-like friend on the ground. The drawing is repeated three time in the same panel, once for each comment by the two guys.]
Pole-guy: The sky is so blue, and all the leaves are green.
Friend: Haven't you ever wondered if we really see the same colors as everyone else? It's all perception.
Pole-guy: Well, you might as well call into question all of human experience. Who really knows what world someone else sees?
Friend: Yeah, I guess.
Pole-guy: Anyway, can you help me down from this pole?
Friend: What pole?
[Cueball standing alone.]
Cueball: I promise to never again squeeze humor out of self-reference.
[Cueball standing alone - beat panel.]
[Cueball standing alone.]
Cueball: God dammit.
[Caption in a black frame above the image written in normal letters not all caps:]
Another from my high-school notebooks.
[A sheep and a green saguaro cactus in a brown pot is linked by an arcing yellow electricity bolt.]
[Cueball is staring at an empty box on the floor.]
In what scientists are calling "pretty gay", I can't find my shoes.
[Cueball is talking to his Cueball-like friend about a car that resembles a Volkswagen Beetle. Above the drawing is a statement:]
My hobby: whenever anyone calls something an [adjective]-ass [noun], I mentally move the hyphen one word to the right.
Cueball: Man, that's a sweet ass-car.
[Cueball is standing holding a bowl in his hand. His son is sitting on the floor playing video games.]
Cueball: Hey, these don't taste like apples!
Son: Fuck off, Dad.
[A boy is glaring at a model sailing ship floating in a bowl of water.]
Boy: Sooner or later, my friend, one of us will run out of time.
[A crowd of figures stand around in the dark. One figure is illuminated by a beam of light.]
In a dark and confusing world, you burn brightly. I never feel lost.
[A tree holding a chainsaw over a recently cut-down tree. The first text is in a frame at the top of the panel.]
I found this in one of my high-school notebooks. I think I drew it just to take revenge on people snooping through my stuff.
Tree stump: Well, you stumped me...
[Cueball holding a golf club.]
Cueball: I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by threatening my agent with a golf club.
[Nine red spiders, with round appendages at the end of each of their six legs, are seen navigating an environment of blocks and other geometric constructions. One spider appears to be holding a block down for another spider to climb onto to help it up, or they might be lifting the block together. One is almost outside the frame at the top.]
[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another.]
Cueball: I love you!
Megan: I love you!
[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another.]
Cueball: I love you more!
Megan: Yeah.
[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another - saying nothing.]
[Black Hat and Cueball are standing next to each other. Above them the text is written in a box with shades around it.]
Schrödinger's Comic
[Black Hat and Cueball are still standing next to each other, but Cueball has lifted his arms above his head. The text is again written in a box with shades around it.]
The last panel of this comic is both funny and not funny at the same time.
[Black Hat and Cueball are still standing next to each other, Cueball arms are down again. The text is again written in a box with shades around it.]
Until you read it, there's no way to tell which it will end up being.
[Black Hat and Cueball are still standing next to each other. Cueball has become smaller and smaller through the three frames after the first. Quite clearly here in the last panel. The text is again written in a box with shades around it.]
Shit.
[Drawing of a lonely girl staring down with almost closed eyes. The first line of text stands next to her to the left. The last part bottom, right.]
I just want you to share in my secrets
and not run away
[A stack of stick figures, standing on each others shoulders extends from the bottom of the frame to the top. Cuboids hang in the air.]
The counter-red-spider offensive begins...
[Cueball and Megan are standing on a white hill (presumably snow) with a grey sky covered with thick streaks of white, and small pink dots. All letters are written in lower case.]
we are just two people
who found each other
[Cueball is standing talking in the same position in all four panels. Seems like he has hair in panel 2.]
Cueball: I want to be brave enough to tell you how I feel.
Cueball: I want to say "I love you" before I hang up the phone for once.
Cueball: I want to drive all night with you, listening to mix tapes, not caring where we end up.
Cueball: Oh, and I also really want to get with your sister.
Cueball: I mean, DAMN.
[A color drawing of Tycho, a man with wild brown hair in blue and cyan colored shirt. He has a big open mouth and holds one arm up while the other may be in his (unseen) pocket. He has two speech bubbles,]
Tycho: You know what? If you've never played the 1995 SNES RPG 'Seiken Densetsu' don't even bother reading today's strip. 
Tycho: We don't need your kind here.
[Four Cueball-like children wearing party hats, a discarded balloon is lying to the right. The first part of the text is written above the children, the second below.]
We had a malaria party 
but it turned out not to be very much fun.
[A multitude of circles connected with several lines. Most of them are rather small and colored red, yellow, green and blue. Nine of them are white, six of these are larger than all the other circles, but one is the same size as the largest colored (green) circle, and the two smallest are smaller than a few of the colored circles. Pieces of text are written in all the white circles. Although it can be confusing at first, the reading order is still the normal one: left to right and top to bottom. Reading the circles in that order gives the following text:]
"Everybody has a secret world inside of them.
All of the people in the whole world
I mean everybody
No matter how dull and boring they are on the outside
Inside they've all got unimaginable
magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing, worlds
Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands, maybe."

[A graph with a curve that begins at zero, then peaks at a given frequency, indicated via a thin vertical line, and then fades down towards zero. It is possible to see the data point, which the curve fits perfectly. The Y-axis is labeled. Along the X-axis the zero point and the frequency where the peak has its maximum are labeled and close to the arrow the unit of this axis is written.]
Y-axis: Energy Density
Along the X-axis:

Robert Smith should do a cover of
Coldplay's Clocks, so when he sings
"Am I part of the cure or am I part of the disease?"
we can say, "Ooh, we know this one!"
[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another.]
Megan: Why didn't you wait for me?
Cueball: I thought you were gone forever!
[Megan throws out her arms.]
Megan: I said I'd be back in a minute!
Cueball: The... the seconds went fast at first, but then they started to drag on.
Cueball: She was there for me.
[Megan still have her arms out although less.]
Megan: You had an affair in the 90 seconds I was gone?!
Cueball: ... Yes.
[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another in a smaller panel.]
Cueball: And we had a son.
[Same as previous panel.]
Cueball: He'd be about your age now.
We already have a page for him. I've adjusted the two pages that refer to him in the title text to wikilink his name like the third already did. Mark Hurd (talk) 01:37, 26 June 2013 (UTC)

[Cueball and Megan are having a conversation.]
Cueball: Why do you love me?
Megan: I don't know; my heart never gave me a choice.
Cueball: Aww.
[No dialogue.]
Megan: I wish it had.
That is an odd interpretation. If it was a "sad sound", it would have been an "oh..." rather than an "aww", which is pretty much always used as a "that's sweet!" sound. Add to the fact that "my heart never gave me a choice" is rather sappy, yeah the joke is the mood killer in the last panel.  108.162.250.162 (talk)  (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
[Megan and Blondie are talking.]
Blondie: What do you want to do when you graduate?
Megan: I want to become a lighthouse operator.
Blondie: Oh?
Megan: Yeah.
[Cut to scene of lighthouse with text overlaid.]
Megan: Lighthouses are built on interesting pieces of coast, so I'll have an interesting place to walk and swim, and great views of all kinds of weather. I'd feel good about myself and my work every single day.
[Cut back to the two girls.]
Megan: I'd get to be the girl in the tower, only I'd be the one rescuing people.
Megan: Why, what do you want to do?
Blondie: I'm going to grad school. I don't really know why.
Megan: Wanna come hang in my lighthouse over breaks?
Blondie: ...yeah.
Randall talks about Miss Lenhart only a few months later, in 135: Substitute. It's impossible for us to know whether he had her in mind or not at this time, but the character ambiguity is standard for xkcd (not less so in the early ones). Since she is at least relevant in any investigation of Miss Lenhart, I'll include her in the categories, and it'll be open for everyone to make up their own minds! –St.nerol (talk) 20:37, 5 March 2013 (UTC)
Even teachers were once aimless students. Perhaps this conversation inspired Lenhart to be a teacher 18:23, 10 September 2014 (UTC)
Well there is not reason to believe all blonde girls are Miss Lenhart, or a young Mrs. Roberts or her daughter Elaine Roberts. Hence a new character Blondie has been created after a discussion. And this woman is then of course her. --Kynde (talk) 05:26, 10 September 2016 (UTC)

Stacy, do you remember when I mowed your lawn? (mowed your lawn)
Your mom came out with just a towel on (towel on)
I could tell she liked me from the way she stared (the way she stared)
And the way she said, "You missed a spot over there" (a spot over there)
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
But since your dad walked out, your mom could use a guy like me
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
She's all I want, and I've waited so long
Stacy, can't you see you're just not the girl for me
I know it might be wrong,
but I'm in love with Stacy's mom
[A hairy man.]
Man: Look, I know you think that since I walked out she could use a guy like you. But trust me. That woman has got a lot going on, and you want none of it. 
Man: Get out while you still can.

In the interests of community-decisions, I concur.  Good explanation that refers to the lyrics (nice inclusion of them, too) to explain the joke.  Not incomplete at all. --BigMal // 173.245.55.88 15:17, 5 February 2014 (UTC)
At the time the tag was added, the explanation section was simply a copy-paste of the lyrics with no explanation.  The explanation has since been fleshed out, but the tag was never removed.  I agree; it's complete now. 141.101.99.229 17:51, 5 February 2014 (UTC)

Well there is 677 "Green Flash", in which the only "joke" centers around the idea of Black Hat knocking Cueball unconscious so he can steal his car.  And I believe there are any number of comics where one of the protagonists is pummeled or otherwise harmed, either on or off panel, with the intent that we laugh at it.  I believe there is a continuum of such humor in xkcd, along with all the "intellectual" humor as well.  I don't think this one is interesting on that particular basis.  108.162.219.58 01:48, 1 February 2014 (UTC)

I don't follow your sentence "you'll either have a one and a zero, two ones, or two zeroes", please can you try and explain more clearly. Essentially though, there are two possible solutions to the puzzle:


0

1

or alternatively

1

0


1

0

0

1
The only thing which can make the difficultly change is how many cells are pre-filled. If 0 are filled then either both solutions are correct, or it is impossible to know which solution is correct. If 1 cell is filled, then it is easy to complete the rest of the grid. If 2 are filled, then it is even easier to complete, and easier again with 3 filled. --Pudder (talk) 11:01, 28 July 2015 (UTC)

I fixed the image by resaving it in an image editing application.  I, too, am perplexed why the original wouldn't display properly.  The weird orientation doesn't seem to explain why it would fail to display at all.  Perhaps it has something to do with the image being a link (e.g., the browser prepares a link area that's 372 x 300, then tries to fill it with an image that renders to 300 x 372 instead, and pukes).  Regardless, it's easier to fix the image than to fix the browser. Daddy (talk) 04:35, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

[Tendrils from the frame develop and grow inwards while breaking the outer frame down. The tendrils comes close to Cueball. There are 13, three from three of the four sides and four from the right.]
[The tendrils have now completely broken the outer frame down and 11 have reached Cueball and these begins to wind themselves around him. There are tendrils around his forehead, neck, cheek, left arm, left wrist, left hand, right wrist, right hand, lower torso, left leg and right leg. Those around his legs spiraling almost up to his crotch. 14 other tendrils have not reached him yet. All those reaching him was among the 13 from the previous panel. Only the two from the bottom right corner did not make contact. The other 12 not reaching him where new.]
[Finally the 11 tendrils that have reached Cueball retract along with the other 14 tendrils back to the frame, tearing Cueball apart in 9 pieces, leaving one central piece (his upper torso with a part of each arm) floating in the center without tendrils on it. His head has been split in two by three tendrils, that keep the parts close together. The left arm with one tendril has been split from the hand with two tendrils, whereas the two holding the wrist and hand kept their part of the arm in one piece. The two legs have been separated from the lower torso at the crotch, and they as well as the lower torso is all being pulled away by one tendril. The other tendrils have almost reached the frame, three of them are already gone leaving 11 near the frame. The frame has also nearly reformed it self again.]

My apartment
1=t
2=(t*(1+√2))/3
3=(t*√5)/3

When I'm walking, I worry a lot about the efficiency of my path.
The equation #2 comes from the second route. t(1+√2)/3 is how far the second path takes the guy. If each block is a unit square, the diagonal to the corner is √2 while the next part is 1. The t/3 part is making it comparable to the first one (the first one is t despite it being 3 unit squares). Equation #3 is t√(5)/3. Plugging 1, 2, and √5 into wolfram|alpha for triangle side lengths makes it a right triange, so the √5 comes from the side length (assuming unit squares) while the t/3 makes it comparable to the first one.Mulan15262 (talk) 02:36, 1 December 2014 (UTC)
Based on his times, it is two squares with the same side length. Base on that geometry, Path #2 will be the hypotenuse of a 45 degree right triangle. t = √(20^2 + 20^2) = 20 * √2 = 48.28. Path #3 would be t = √(20^2 + 40^2) = 20 * √5 = 44.72. Not sure where you got roughly 40 from. Were you thinking of the sin of 30 degree rule where the hypotenuse is double the opposite side? In this case, the adjacent is double the opposite which puts the hypotenuse at √5 times the opposite.Flewk (talk) 17:10, 24 December 2015 (UTC)

Black Hat: Gravitational mass is identical to inertial mass. That is, the amount of inertia something has and the amount of gravity it has are effectively the same. What's interesting is that there doesn't seem to be any reason this should be true. One could imagine an extremely large object with lots of resistance to force and no gravity (or vice versa), but this is never observed.
Black Hat: You know what? I'm just gonna skip the rest of the buildup and say it: Yo mama's fat.
 There are two ways to look at mass; through gravity and through inertia. When you look at it through gravity then mass is basically how much a body is affected by gravity, or how much gravity it has. When you look at it through inertia then mass is how much a body resists changes velocity, ie. how hard it is to make a body (like a car) accelerate/decelerate. It turns out that looking at it boths ways gives the same result (same mass). --BorisIvanBabic (talk) 10:04, 27 September 2013 (UTC)
In other words, apparently, inertial and gravitational mass for a given body are always identical, or rather reflect the same underlying characteristic of the body which we measure as mass, for any object in the universe; although certain theories explain why this might be the case, none adequately explain why it must be. ---Jolbucley (talk) 04:45, 29 January 2014 (UTC)
 Or just link it with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle#Development_of_gravitation_theory .Wikipedia usually explains things better than anything short of a school book. Tora (talk) 22:34, 3 February 2014 (UTC)
Nice job. Internal links do work like this (look at my edit):

The paragraph you're referring to is meant to sum up what actually happened in the comic, not explain the premise the humor is derived from. It assumes you as the reader were unaware that black hat was setting up for a joke, just as the audience would be. 162.158.72.35 17:34, 20 July 2016 (UTC)

I agree. I've put more time into C&amp;C than CS and I immediately connect this with the Valve game. Additionally, units in C&amp;C are inherently light sources, so they are grue-proof. I am going to change the explain. 173.245.54.63 18:06, 23 July 2016 (UTC)

[Hairy is on the street. Behind him is a house with a lawn.]
Hairy's thoughts: I love the time just before sunrise. It's quiet; no one is ever just walking about. It's like a secret. I always hope that I'll find someone else quietly hiding from sleep, and we'll see each other and sit and talk. I guess this is a bad place to meet people. I wish it weren't.
[Hairy goes into the house, brushes his teeth, and leaves the house again.]

Phone: Do you think I could mail a running chainsaw to someone?
Cueball: I doubt it.
Phone: What about a baby's first word?
Cueball: Look, your obsession with sending strange things through the mail is getting out of hand.
Phone: Can you mail a blank stare?
Phone: A dizzying height?
Phone: Pi?
Cueball: ...
Phone: Well, did you at least get that package of time I sent you?
Cueball: I... you... no, I didn't.
Phone: Well, there was a lot of it, so it will probably take a while.
 If it were the black hat guy, he'd have something more snarky to say. This cue ball's character is more in line with beret guy.
&#160;: Black hat does have an obsession about these things. see 325. This seems to be likely that it's him. But ill leave the desicion to someone else. 162.158.2.139 05:23, 7 June 2016 (UTC)

Yes, that lyric is indeed in the song. But Randall is reflecting on the hilariously ironic "stereotypical bubblegum punk whiny teenager lyrics" as described above, not the bizarre explanation you have above. I understand if you're a Simple Plan fan, but judging by this comic Randall isn't. 18.215.1.197 22:00, 26 May 2013 (UTC)
Sorry I am late, but it seems we are just living at different time zones. I am not native English because I am from Germany, but I thought that "teenage angst" also mentioned at the Wiki page should stay at this explanation. I was also hoping someone else would participate here at this discussion. So I am sure we will find the REAL explain. I am with you. --Dgbrt (talk) 20:35, 27 May 2013 (UTC)

[Various people struggle as the comic disintegrates. Toward the top, people are standing calmly, some holding hands. As the parts of the comic break apart, people try to reach for each other, hold parts together, or curl up into a ball. By the bottom, a person is falling, surrounded by pieces of the comic.]
